# Recipe

Hey guys I wanted to play around in **markdown** for the longest, So I figured we'd use it to make our recipe! 

Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax designed so that it optionally can be converted to HTML using a tool by the same name. Markdown is popularly used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums or in text editors for the quick creation of rich text documents. -wiki-

If you'd like a [cheatsheet] (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to help with Markdown. You can just slap raw HTML in here too!

# Anyway, lets get to making our recipe!
